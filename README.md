# SpaceShip_Titanic
In 2912, the Spaceship Titanic collided with a spacetime anomaly near Alpha Centauri, transporting half of its 13,000 passengers to an alternate dimension. Rescue efforts are ongoing.


# Spaceship Titanic Project

## Overview
Predict which passengers were transported to an alternate dimension.

## Folder Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw and processed data files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for EDA, preprocessing, and modeling.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
- `models/`: Directory to store trained models.
- `submissions/`: Stores CSV files for Kaggle submissions.
- `tests/`: Unit tests for scripts.

## How to Run
1. Preprocess data using `data_preprocessing.py`.
2. Train models using `train_model.py`.
3. Predict and generate submission using `predict.py`.
